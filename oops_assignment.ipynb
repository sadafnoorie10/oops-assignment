        "A1) The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**:\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. This is often achieved through access modifiers (e.g., public, private, protected).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**:\n",
        "   - Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It allows programmers to focus on interactions at a higher level without worrying about the underlying complexity. This is often achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define methods without providing their implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**:\n",
        "   - Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class (the child or subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. The subclass can override or extend the functionalities of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**:\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even if they are actually instances of a subclass. This means that a single function or method can work in different ways depending on the object it is operating on. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Classes and Objects**:\n",
        "   - Classes are blueprints for creating objects, defining attributes and methods. An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and behavior. Classes define the structure and capabilities of the objects, while objects are the actual entities created based on these definitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "These five concepts work together to create a programming paradigm that is modular, reusable, and easier to manage. By organizing code into classes and objects, OOP helps in building complex systems while keeping code clean and maintainable."

        "1. **Class Definition**:\n",

        "   - The `display_info` method formats and prints the car's information.\n",

        "   - An instance of the `Car` class is created with specific values, and the `display_info` method is called to print the car's details.\n",

        "\n",
        "A7) ### Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method Resolution Order (MRO)** is a crucial concept in Python, particularly in the context of multiple inheritance. It defines the order in which base classes are searched when executing a method or accessing an attribute. The MRO determines which method will be invoked when a method is called on an instance of a class that inherits from multiple classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Points:\n",
        "- The MRO follows the **C3 linearization** algorithm, which ensures a consistent and predictable order.\n",
        "- It allows for resolving method conflicts in a systematic way.\n",
        "- In Python, you can retrieve the MRO for a class using the `mro()` method or the `__mro__` attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of MRO\n",
        "\n",
        "Hereâ€™s an example illustrating MRO in a multiple inheritance scenario:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"A\"\n",

        "- Class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`.\n",
        "- When `d.speak()` is called, Python looks for the `speak` method in the order defined by the MRO. Since `B` comes before `C` in the MRO, the method from `B` is invoked, returning \"B\".\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Class Definition (`Vector`)**:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Overriding `__str__`**:\n",
        "   - The `__str__` method is defined to return a string representation of the `Vector` instance in the format `Vector(x, y)`. This method is called when you use the `print()` function or `str()` on an instance of `Vector`.\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: This allows for a readable string representation of the object, making it easier to understand when printing the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Overriding `__add__`**:\n",
        "   - The `__add__` method allows instances of the `Vector` class to be added together using the `+` operator. It checks if the other object being added is also a `Vector`. If so, it creates and returns a new `Vector` whose `x` and `y` components are the sums of the corresponding components of the two vectors.\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: This allows for intuitive addition of vector objects using the `+` operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Usage\n",
        "- **Creating Vectors**: Two vectors `v1` and `v2` are created with components `(2, 3)` and `(5, 7)`, respectively.\n",
        "- **Printing Vectors**: When `print(v1)` or `print(v2)` is called, the `__str__` method is invoked, providing a readable format for the output.\n",
        "- **Adding Vectors**: The expression `v1 + v2` calls the `__add__` method, resulting in a new vector `v3` with components `(7, 10)`.\n",

        "### Output\n",
        "When you run the code, you should see:\n",

        "### Summary\n",
        "By overriding the `__str__` method, you enhance the readability of your object instances, while overriding the `__add__` method allows you to define custom behavior for the addition operator, enabling intuitive arithmetic operations on your class instances."

        "     - Calculates the execution time and prints it.\n",
        "     - Returns the result of the original function.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Applying the Decorator**:\n",
        "   - The `@time_execution` syntax is used to apply the decorator to `example_function`.\n",
        "   - When `example_function` is called, it is wrapped in the `wrapper` function defined in the decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Example Usage**:\n",
        "   - In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, `example_function` is called with a large input (`1000000`), which sums the numbers from `0` to `n-1`.\n",
        "   - The execution time is printed alongside the result.\n",
        "\n",

        "### Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class Definition (`YearChecker`)**:\n",
        "   - The class `YearChecker` is defined to encapsulate the static method.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Static Method (`is_leap_year`)**:\n",
        "   - The `is_leap_year` method is decorated with `@staticmethod`, which allows it to be called on the class itself without requiring an instance.\n",
        "   - The method takes one parameter, `year`, and checks if it meets the leap year conditions:\n",
        "     - If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400, the method returns `True` (indicating it is a leap year).\n",
        "     - Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Example Usage**:\n",
        "   - In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, a list of years is defined to check.\n",
        "   - The program iterates over this list and calls the `is_leap_year` static method for each year, printing whether it is a leap year or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output\n",
        "When you run the code, you will see output like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "2000 is a leap year.\n",
        "2001 is not a leap year.\n",
        "1900 is not a leap year.\n",
        "2024 is a leap year.\n",
        "2023 is not a leap year.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "This example demonstrates how to define a static method in a class that checks if a given year is a leap year. Static methods are useful for utility functions that don't require access to instance or class-specific data."
